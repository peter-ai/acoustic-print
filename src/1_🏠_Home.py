A web application which uses audio feature data from the Free Music Archive (FMA; 2018)
to create visual acoustic fingerprints of songs and compare audio characteristics across the
music catalogue. The app uses a MySQL backend and is built on Streamlit.

        ### Context
        An audio or acoustic fingerprint is a digital summary that can be generated from an audio signal deterministically. 
        Generally, it allows for the lookup of similar audio signals and helps identify an audio signal so it can be 
        recognized quickly later. 
        
        **Acoustic-Print** is a project that seeks to develop a visual representation of an acoustic fingerprint with a similar 
        foundation in mind; the acoustic fingerprint should be deterministic and songs that are similar in audio features should
        have similar acoustic-prints. The acoustic-print of a song is split into two visualizations, one representing Rhythm & Dynamics
        (comprised of valence, energy, and danceability) and the other Articulation & Texture (comprised of speechiness, instrumentalness, 
        and acousticness), with embedding information about the tempo of the song.
